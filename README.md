# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking for opportunities to explore new programming languages and improve my problem-solving skills. This project is an implementation of a recursive factorial calculator in Rust, designed to deepen my understanding of Rust's syntax, memory management, and struct-based object-oriented programming.

This program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion and tracks the intermediate computation steps. The project demonstrates Rust's handling of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions with ownership and references, and object-oriented techniques using `struct` and `impl`.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- Rust Programming Language (Stable Version)
- VS Code (with Rust Analyzer extension for better development experience)
- Windows Command Prompt (for compilation and execution)

# Useful Websites

- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example)
- [Rust Standard Library Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
- [Rust Ownership and Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)

# Future Work

While the factorial calculator works as expected, there are several improvements and additions I plan to implement:

- [Enhanced Error Handling]: Improve user input validation and error messages.
- [Graphical Interface]: Develop a simple GUI using Rustâ€™s `egui` or `GTK` to make the tool more user-friendly.
- [Logging System]: Add structured logging to record each step of the calculation.
- [Benchmarking]: Compare the performance of recursive vs. iterative factorial calculations.

This project has been a great introduction to Rust, and I look forward to further exploring its features and ecosystem.
